# Bug Category: Remote Code Execution

# The logic of the case09.php is: 
# 1. the user trigger a POST request of the form by clicking "Go" button at line10
# 2. the POST request has parameter of name = "cmd_url" and value = "netstat -an" at line 9
# 3. the POST param cmd_url is used as the input to shell_exec() at line 19
# 4. the output from the shell_exec() is echoed to the client as <pre> tag text

# Exploit: 
# shell_exec is vulnerable to command injection, and the php script does not offer any input validation
# or input escaping defenses, so we can send a POST request with "cmd_url" parameter being an OS command
# to Dump the serverâ€™s password file: cat /etc/passwd
