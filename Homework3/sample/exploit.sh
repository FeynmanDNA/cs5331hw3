# Bug Category: Persistent XSS

# The logic of the sample.php is: 
# 1. the user input their title and content at line 70 and 75 in sample.php
# 2. the php script will store it into the database at line 18 in sample.php
# 3. the php script will retrieve the content from the database and display to the user at line 51 in sample.php

# Exploit: 
# We can see that there is no sanitization function for the user input, so a user can insert javascript code into the database and the next time when the web server retrieve the content from the databsae and show it to the user, the javascript will be executed and leading to a persistent xss attack.
