# Bug Category: Mix Content

# The logic of the case04.php is: 
# 1. the php script will redirect the request from HTTP connection to HTTPS at line4-7 of case04.php (if HTTPS is on)
# 2. the php script will also send a cookie with the flag
# 3. the page requested via HTTP for an image 'http://www.wsb.com/Homework3/res/images/image.png' at line 21 of case04.php

# Exploit: 
# Mixed Content: The page at 'https://www.wsb.com/Homework3/case04.php' was loaded over HTTPS,
# but requested an insecure image 'http://www.wsb.com/Homework3/res/images/image.png'.
# This content should also be served over HTTPS.
