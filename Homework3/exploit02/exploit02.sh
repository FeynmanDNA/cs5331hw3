# Bug Category: PHP Injection

# The logic of the cas02.php is: 
# 1. the user input in the textfield
# 2. the value in the textfield will be assigned to "something"
# 3. the php script will send $something as GET parameter
# 4. the php script will use the build a command of echo with the "something" parameter as input in line21
# 5. line22, the assembled echo "something" will be executed by the eval() 

# Exploit: 
# no sanitization function for the user input, and no sanitization for the assembled echo command
# we can basically inject code for the PHP eval() to run
# if we use $flag as the "something" parameter, it will be echoed in eval()
