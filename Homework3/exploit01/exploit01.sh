# Bug Category: Local File Inclusion

# The logic of the case01.php is: 
# 1. user select the language dropdown, triggers loadAnotherLang()
# 2. loadAnotherLang() will send a post request with payload {LANG: lang}
# 3. LANG parameter is used to locate a local file in "include" directory at line37 in case01.php
# 4. the LANG param is substituted as the php filename in line 'includes/'.$lang.'.php' 
# 4. include() in php will copy the content of that file to the current file

# Exploit: 
# manually set $LANG to a local file path
# provide a relative path ../ and points to the local file lfi.txt.php
# send post request with the local file path as LANG param
# to capture the flag in lfi.txt.php at Homework3 directory
