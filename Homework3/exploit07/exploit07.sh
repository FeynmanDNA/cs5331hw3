# Bug Category: Execution after Redirect

# The logic of the case07.php is: 
# 1. php script will use header() function sends a raw HTTP header to a client, in this case Location
# 2. the Location HTTP header will instruct the client (browser) to redirect to case07-1.php

# Exploit: 
# using python3 requests, we can set allow_redirects to False
# this will disable automatic redirects, and we will be able to see the old site before redirect
# the old site case07.php will execute the old <div id="demo"> with the flag

#!/bin/bash
python3 exploit07.py
