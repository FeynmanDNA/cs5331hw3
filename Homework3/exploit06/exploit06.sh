# Bug Category: CSRF Predictable tokens

# The logic of the case06.php is: 
# 1. the php script will send POST request along with a CSRF token at line7 and line9
# 2. the CSRF token however is echoed in clear text in the HTML at line16 of case06.php
# 3. the POST request will pass "data" parameter to be echoed to the screen

# Exploit: 
# forge a POST request with the obtained CSRF token in the POST body
# param using {"csrf_token": "wkjdb-iouer-234k3-wklu3k", "data": "..."} and get a successful post

#!/bin/bash
